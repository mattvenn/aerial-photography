#Structure

* 2 hours, 30 kids, upper KS2
* 2 sessions per day at same school

#Prep

* inflate one balloon
* test flasher demo

#Todo

* finish lesson plan : 2 hr
    * done: 3d photo of Pi
    * done: h2o fuel cell car explanation
    * done: do the sums for volume and lift and check they work!
    * branding
    * done: get worksheet checked
* chassis build : 1 hr
    * chassis should let reprogram arduino easily, allow hdmi and usb port easy access
    * winder? string? - ordered a tester from ebay
    * valve design & build : 1 hr - investigate bungs, ordered
    * led test, brighter and multi colour : do with fc test : 2hrs
    * build kits : 3 hrs
    * change timings on h2mdk lib back
    * longer test
        * either another fc or more pressure
        * done: test separate balloon, worked with 2 cells.
        * try double balloon
    * test duracell phone charger battery
* software:
    * done: extension to cymple si's scratch to add camera capability. : 2hrs
    * done: scratch program
    * scratch autoboot
    * time is always reset, so photos were merged. Need to delete all photos first.
    * crontab boot python alternative

#Isle of Wight

* bookings so far: 14
* Feimatta does risk assessment
* How is h2 being generated on island - electricity, sunstainable from solar

#Technical notes

* helium has 1g lift per litre.
* h2 has 1.2g lift per litre.
* took 5 mins to inflate to 3m circumference, this was a 'bit more' than neutral buoyancy. 
* When wind blew it blew down fairly quickly
* h2mdk defaults were adapted for a 200ms purge every 30 seconds to cope with low h2 pressure.

# Questions

* latex degredation - testing. Done 3 fills so far
* h&s warning pre lesson?

# Requirements 

* string attachment stuff
    * ordered caribiners
* valve stuff
    * ordered bungs
    * attacher for filling
* plumbing - manual purge for h2, splitter? Arlan sending up
* wiring: switch for adding pi after h2mdk ready, multi colour led for status
* chassis
* scales
* (keyboard), mouse, vga converter
* nice box for it all to go in.
* spare parts
    * fuel cells
    * string
    * balloons
    * bits to build complete extra chassis
    * sd cards
    * sd adapter
    * charge battery for safety
    * battery pack with velcro
    
* done: scratch printouts images http://scratched.media.mit.edu/resources/vector-scratch-blocks:
* print and laminate x 8
