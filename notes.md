#gotchas

* issues with fuel cell powering pi 2nd test
* quick attach for payload and string
* manual purge for h2
* switch for adding pi after h2mdk ready

* must enable raspi camera before it can be used!
otherwise get confusing out of memory error from picamera

* took 5 mins to inflate to 3m circumference, this was a 'bit more' than neutral buoyancy. 

* When wind blew it blew down fairly quickly

* h2 stuff worked as long as engage pi after arduino had started

* how to get pi to start when it can't do the arduino stuff?

* time is always reset, so photos were merged. Need to delete all photos first.

* latex degredation
