#Technical notes

* helium has 1g lift per litre.
* h2 has 1.2g lift per litre.
* took 5 mins to inflate to 3m circumference, this was a 'bit more' than neutral buoyancy. 
* When wind blew it blew down fairly quickly

# Questions

* latex degredation - testing. Done 2 launches so far
* h&s warning pre lesson?
