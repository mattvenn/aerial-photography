#Structure

* 2 hours, 30 kids, upper KS2
* 2 sessions per day at same school

#Prep

* inflate one balloon
* test flasher demo

# Training Plan

## Things to decide

* limit height of balloon
* h&s warning pre lesson?

## things to note

* latex degredation - testing. Done lots fills so far

## things to practice

* fuel cell replacement / storage
* 

#Todo

* finish lesson plan : 2 hr
    * host lesson plan html somewhere with link label
    * backup in case pi display fails: screen shots on a usb stick
    * get copies of scratch loop demos on the pi for demo
    * proof read
        * scratch program pics, check they line up with what we're using
    * done: 3d photo of Pi
    * done: h2o fuel cell car explanation
    * done: do the sums for volume and lift and check they work!
    * branding
    * done: get worksheet checked
* chassis build : 1 hr
    * done: chassis should let reprogram arduino easily, allow hdmi and usb port easy access
    * done: winder? string? - ordered a tester from ebay
    * done: valve design & build : 1 hr - investigate bungs, ordered. works but is heavy. ordered some 8mm hose clamps and hose
    * done: led test, brighter and multi colour : do with fc test : 2hrs
    * build kits : 3 hrs
        * done: buy scales
        * done: pi vga cable
        * check we can do all with a mouse
    * done: change timings on h2mdk lib back
    * done: longer test
        * either another fc or more pressure
        * done: test separate balloon, worked with 2 cells.
        * try double balloon
    * test duracell phone charger battery
* software:
    * done: extension to cymple si's scratch to add camera capability. : 2hrs
    * done: scratch program
    * done: scratch autoboot
    * done: time is always reset, so photos were merged. Need to delete all photos first.
    * crontab boot python alternative

#Isle of Wight

* bookings so far: 14
* Feimatta does risk assessment
* How is h2 being generated on island - electricity, sunstainable from solar

#Technical notes

* helium has 1g lift per litre.
* h2 has 1.2g lift per litre.
* took 5 mins to inflate to 3m circumference, this was a 'bit more' than neutral buoyancy. 
* When wind blew it blew down fairly quickly
* h2mdk defaults were adapted for a 200ms purge every 30 seconds to cope with low h2 pressure.


# Requirements 

* string attachment stuff
* valve stuff
* scales
* (keyboard), mouse, vga converter, cable
* nice box for it all to go in.
* spare parts/tools
    * small flat screwdriver for fuelcell
    * fuel cells
    * string
    * weather balloons
    * fuel cell balloons
    * bits to build complete extra chassis
    * sd cards, pre loaded
    * sd adapter
    * charge battery for safety
    * battery pack with velcro
    
* done: scratch printouts images http://scratched.media.mit.edu/resources/vector-scratch-blocks:
* print and laminate x 8
