#structure

2 hours, 30 kids

## what do we need?

## lift.

Q: ask for suggestions: hydrogen, helium. 

How do we find out how much lift hydrogen and helium have? web search
helium has 1g lift per litre.
h2 has 1.2g lift per litre.

how much do we need? How much are we going to lift?

## payload

Q: what is our payload going to be?
A: camera, but how do we get it to take photos over and over? Use a computer

Q: where else do we use computers?
A: gps, watches, phones, shopping checkouts

draw your computer onto the balloon.

Q: has anyone written a computer program before?
A: hopefully people are used to scratch. discuss what we need to take the photos.

## power

batteries or fuelcell?

### challenge

* write a computer program that makes scratch say hello
* create a variable and increase it by one every time

## raspberry pi

if we can, hook it up to the projecter and use a keyboard and mouse. Otherwise we'll have the program ready.

## python programming - demonstration

python is used for writing computer programs. It is textual, so instead of dragging pictures around, we write the words.

show a python program that prints out hello and a number every time. Then modify it so it changes to picture1.jpg ... etc

show a python program that can take a photo ,and show the photo.

merge the 2 files.

## test

start the program running on the pi and check photos are being taken.

## launch!

* go outside and all fill balloons
* tie all together - use something to tie it all
* pay out raspi
* get kids to spell out words on the playground
* wind back

## plenary

what did we learn?

* computers aren't only laptops
* writing a loop and increasing numbers
* we can write programs that do cool things outside
* hydrogen is a gas we can use for lifting

## get photos off

and give (usb keyring?) to the teacher.

#equipment:

* scales
* raspberry pi
* pi camera
* battery pack 
* h2
* balloons
* lots of little strings
* long string

#todo

* research lighter battery packs, but if can do with off-the-shelf then easier for teachers
* will we have access to computers to write the program?
* can we use a fuelcell + hydrogen?
