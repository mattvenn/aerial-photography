#Todo

* finish lesson plan : 2 hr
    * h2o fuel cell car explanation
* chassis build : 1 hr
    * valve design & build : 1 hr - investigate bungs

#Isle of Wight

* bookings so far: 14
* Feimatta does risk assessment
* How is h2 being generated on island - electricity, sunstainable from solar

#Technical notes

* helium has 1g lift per litre.
* h2 has 1.2g lift per litre.
* took 5 mins to inflate to 3m circumference, this was a 'bit more' than neutral buoyancy. 
* When wind blew it blew down fairly quickly

# Questions

* latex degredation - testing. Done 2 launches so far
* h&s warning pre lesson?

# Requirements 

* attacher for filling
* string attachment stuff
* valve
* plumbing - manual purge for h2, splitter?
* wiring: switch for adding pi after h2mdk ready, multi colour led for status
* chassis
* spare parts
* scales
* keyboard, mouse, vga converter
    * fuel cells
    * string
    * balloons
    * bits to build complete extra chassis
