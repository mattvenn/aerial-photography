#Isle of Wight

* bookings so far: 14
* Feimatta does risk assessment
* How is h2 being generated on island - electricity, sunstainable from solar

#Technical notes

* helium has 1g lift per litre.
* h2 has 1.2g lift per litre.
* took 5 mins to inflate to 3m circumference, this was a 'bit more' than neutral buoyancy. 
* When wind blew it blew down fairly quickly
* h2mdk defaults were adapted for a 200ms purge every 30 seconds to cope with low h2 pressure.
